Car Price Analysis
Objective: The goal of this analysis is to understand the factors that influence the price of a used car. Based on the insights obtained, we aim to provide clear recommendations to a used car dealership on what consumers value in a used car.

Project Structure
Introduction:

Overview of the analysis objective and its significance for a used car dealership.
Import Libraries:

Importing essential libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for data analysis and visualization.
Data Loading:

Loading the dataset vehicles.csv into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Exploration:

Initial exploration to understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
Displaying the first few rows and summary statistics of the dataset.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handling missing data and data preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generating various visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to explore the relationships between different features and the price of used cars.
Modeling:

Implementing multiple regression models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet) to predict car prices.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualizing Model Predictions:

Plotting the actual versus predicted values for each regression model to assess their performance.
Findings and Recommendations:

Summarizing key insights from the data analysis and modeling.
Providing recommendations to the used car dealership on factors that influence car prices and what consumers value in a used car.
Key Insights
Factors Influencing Car Prices:
Vehicle age, mileage, manufacturer, model, condition, fuel type, transmission type, and color are some of the factors that significantly impact the price of a used car.
Consumer Preferences:
Consumers tend to value newer models, lower mileage, and well-maintained cars.
Certain brands and models may have higher resale value due to their reputation for reliability.
Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made to the used car dealership:

Inventory Selection:

Focus on acquiring newer models with lower mileage and in good condition.
Prioritize popular brands and models that have a higher resale value.
Pricing Strategy:

Use the insights from the regression models to set competitive prices that reflect the value consumers place on different car features.
Marketing:

Highlight the key features that consumers value, such as low mileage, good condition, and popular models, in marketing materials and sales pitches.
Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing used car prices and offers actionable recommendations for a used car dealership. By leveraging these insights, the dealership can better meet consumer preferences and optimize their pricing strategy.
